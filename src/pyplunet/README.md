# pyplunet

Client to interact with the Plunet SOAP API. 

Work in progress. 

### TODOs:
- Complete the service methods 
- Streamline handling of complex arguments
- Parse reponses, return pydantic models, add return types
- etc.

Plan is to create PyPI package once the service methods are built out.
